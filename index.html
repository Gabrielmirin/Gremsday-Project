    <meta name="description" content="GI MURIN!!! It feels like only yesterday you failed to tie your shoes and barked at a random dog in your debut. Since then, it's been so much fun watching your streams and being a part of the grem community! Even though its only been 4-ish months since you appeared so much has already happened. Therefore we, the Grems, have decided to showcase our finest work of art, selfies of our grem forms, and a happy birthday message using ancient magic called “a website”.">

An eventful day of feast has come, and I dearly wish thy hast celebrated it with much excitement and bliss. Thy debut hath brought much fun, and every stream since has filled my heart with even more joy than last. Da Fister of Hololive English Justice, from this simple viewers' deepest part of heart, I thank thee most sincerely. With thee and companions' arrival, a most gentle wave of excitement hath sweeped o'er the citizens of the rabbit hole. A chaos like none other enraptured these lands, casting smiles and causing laughter upon our faces. Many sides were blown, tears of joy shed and hearts were filled with warmth. I truly am grateful for it. With that said, I wholeheartedly wish thee a happiest birthday! May your journey be filled with success and happiness! Sincerely, One of thou many Grems</p>

Watching your streams as of late have some of the things I really look forward to each day.  Your chaotic energy and passion for what you do and for the other members is a blast to watch and always manages to put a smile on my face.  Your commitment to your role plays in EN Recollection was by far my favorite story line to witness and what a roller coaster of emotions it was.  Not only that but even in your collabs with other Justice members the way you move your character around on screen for your shenanigans shows just how much fun you are having and when you are having fun, I am sure your viewers are too.  I hope you are really enjoying your time at Hololive because you deserve it all and then some.  I am sure in the future you will face your fair share of hard workdays, but you have so many fans who love you and your fellow members who have gone through it before to support you.  I am just so happy to get to exist in the timeline that you do as well.  Once again Happy Birthday and I cannot wait to see more of what you have for us in the future!</p>

                            <p class="card-text">GG, you are absolutely amazing! Truth be told, at first, i thought you're just a funny gremlin, then clips of Autofister occasionally come my way, and i started taking more notice of you. After that there is the Fauna RPG stream and AmeSame spelling bee, where unexpectedly you showed your intellect and wit. Then ENReco happened. I was mindblown by your roleplaying. The dedication and immersion you showed is amazing. By the end of day 6, i was left in tears. The tragedy of Gonathan with a G shall be remembered for years to come. Like what some other people have said, you brought to us a cinematic masterpiece that Hollywood can never hope to match. Gonathan with a G is truly the greenest green flag, God's strongest soldier, Himmel the Hero. From now on, when asked why I'm doing the right thing, i will use the phrase ""because Gonathan with a G would do the same"". Thank you for being in Hololive and brightening up our days Gigi. I wish you all the best!</p>

Thank you for coming into our lives, Gigi!"</p>

I believe you may have genuinely changed my brain chemistry and psyche, but I'm okay with that! I hope you have an extremely fun birthday and get to eat as many treats as you'd like, you earned it for sure. I'm looking so forward to what you do here in Hololive and I can't wait for the many celebration and milestones you'll get!</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Happy Birthday, Gigi! Thank you so much for your amazing streams! They've been a wonderful source of much-needed laughter for me. Between your numerous gags, commitment to hysterical bits, based takes, infectious singing, and hilarious banter, your streams never fail to bring a smile and a laugh to my desktop. The Visage stream has also become one of my favorite streams of all time. Also, it’s good to hear there’s someone else with a hyper-fixation on Hadestown! I saw it while I was in New York for Breaking Dimensions, and it was breathtaking. I had already been listening to the soundtrack on repeat before that, but after seeing it on stage with all the effects and actors, I gained a new level of obsession with the musical. Oh, and as a freelance writer, the phrase “stand behind me, kitten! Watch how daddy spells this word” now lives rent-free in my mind whenever I’m working with a client. Thank you for that. On the note of writing, I also hope you keep up with your writing! It was inspiring watching you improvise ‘A Knight’s Tale’ on stream, and I’d love to read your stories in the future (or an audio drama—your voice packs are so much fun!). Have a great birthday today! I look forward to all of your future streams!</p>

And even though it's only been a couple of months, you've given us so much stuff, and every stream is really fun! May it be yapping, games, shitposting, or even psychologically traumatizing fandoms, it's really fun. Gremlin as you are, I really like your positive outlook on life; it's so nice to see and inspiring! You're such a talented person and genuinely fun person to listen to. And I'm glad to have met you! So I hope that you'll have a great day today, and I hope that more and more people will get to know you and your craft. You're really fun, Gigi! Let's cheer for more birthdays for many years to come! And once again, happy birthday!</p>

                            <li>- Her name means "Wise, old woman"</li>
                            <li>She carries a very special gene, because she's the only daughter of the last Fiordland kākāpō, Richard Henry. She currently has succesfully laid and hatched 7 eggs, passing this gene along. In 2022 she was infertile, but she took this as an opportunity to play foster mom and raised 2 more chicks. According to the staff, while she was foster mom she ate the most food of all the moms raising babies, having the volunteers work extra hard.</li>

                            <li>- He's named after the Maori name for Mitre Peak, a place in Milford Sound.</li>
                            <li>Rahotu is the grandson of aformentioned Richard Henry, but he was not mothered by Kuia, since his father carried some of this gene, and it's used to artifically inseminate his mom. Making sure it was being spread again! Rahtou had a fungal respitory infection, called Aspergillosis, in the 2019 breeding season. He got treated for this by a team at the Dunedin Wildlife Hospital, where treatment was effective. Although after getting better he also started to get a reputation as escape artist. He's grown up to be a clever bird with a very nice bright green plummage. While he was learning from the older birds during the 2022 breeding season, he again was up to no good, frequently spotted making his way around raiding the food supplies for the nesting moms.</li>

                <p>GI MURIN!!! It feels like only yesterday you failed to tie your shoes and barked at a random dog in your debut. Since then, it's been so much fun watching your streams and being a part of the grem community! Even though its only been 4-ish months since you appeared so much has already happened. Therefore we, the Grems, have decided to showcase our finest work of art, selfies of our grem forms, and a happy birthday message using ancient magic called “a website”.</p>
