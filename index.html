    <meta name="description" content="GI MURIN!!! It feels like only yesterday you failed to tie your shoes and barked at a random dog in your debut. Since then, it's been so much fun watching your streams and being a part of the grem community! Even though its only been 4-ish months since you appeared so much has already happened. Therefore we, the Grems, have decided to showcase our finest work of art, selfies of our grem forms, and a happy birthday message using ancient magic called “a website”.">

Thy debut hath brought much fun, and every stream since has filled my heart with even more joy than last. Da Fister of Hololive English Justice, from this simple viewers' deepest part of heart, I thank thee most sincerely. With thee and companions' arrival, a most gentle wave of excitement hath sweeped o'er the citizens of the rabbit hole. A chaos like none other enraptured these lands, casting smiles and causing laughter upon our faces. Many sides were blown, tears of joy shed and hearts were filled with warmth. I truly am grateful for it. With that said, I wholeheartedly wish thee a happiest birthday! May your journey be filled with success and happiness! Sincerely, One of thou many Grems</p>

Watching your streams as of late have some of the things I really look forward to each day.  Your chaotic energy and passion for what you do and for the other members is a blast to watch and always manages to put a smile on my face.  Your commitment to your role plays in EN Recollection was by far my favorite story line to witness and what a roller coaster of emotions it was.  Not only that but even in your collabs with other Justice members the way you move your character around on screen for your shenanigans shows just how much fun you are having and when you are having fun, I am sure your viewers are too.  I hope you are really enjoying your time at Hololive because you deserve it all and then some.  I am sure in the future you will face your fair share of hard workdays, but you have so many fans who love you and your fellow members who have gone through it before to support you.  I am just so happy to get to exist in the timeline that you do as well.  Once again Happy Birthday and I cannot wait to see more of what you have for us in the future!</p>

                            <p class="card-text">GG, you are absolutely amazing! Truth be told, at first, i thought you're just a funny gremlin, then clips of Autofister occasionally come my way, and i started taking more notice of you. After that there is the Fauna RPG stream and AmeSame spelling bee, where unexpectedly you showed your intellect and wit. Then ENReco happened. I was mindblown by your roleplaying. The dedication and immersion you showed is amazing. By the end of day 6, i was left in tears. The tragedy of Gonathan with a G shall be remembered for years to come. Like what some other people have said, you brought to us a cinematic masterpiece that Hollywood can never hope to match. Gonathan with a G is truly the greenest green flag, God's strongest soldier, Himmel the Hero. From now on, when asked why I'm doing the right thing, i will use the phrase ""because Gonathan with a G would do the same"". Thank you for being in Hololive and brightening up our days Gigi. I wish you all the best!</p>

                <p>GI MURIN!!! It feels like only yesterday you failed to tie your shoes and barked at a random dog in your debut. Since then, it's been so much fun watching your streams and being a part of the grem community! Even though its only been 4-ish months since you appeared so much has already happened. Therefore we, the Grems, have decided to showcase our finest work of art, selfies of our grem forms, and a happy birthday message using ancient magic called “a website”.</p>
